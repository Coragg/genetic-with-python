<h1>Introduction to the project</h1>

<p>This is a university project, but with the difference that I do it in a version of python apart from c.  </p>   

<h2>How work the program:</h2>

<p>First, We need a input of a .txt document. 
Second, the .txt file should have in one line everything information about the proteins of DNA. </p>

Finally the program takes these conditions for decide that the person is mutant or human: 

<ul>
    <li>The chain cannot contain three consecutive guanines.
    <li>The chain must have two consecutive adenines or two cytosines.
    <li>All mutant chains end with a thymine.
</ul>
